                            I'm 32 years old, New Jersey born and bred. I have lived here all my life and have explored many different paths so far.
                            Out of high school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. So, instead of going to college, I decided to pursue my dream of being a musician.

                        <p>
                            I had played drums since I was 12, so I set off to find some like minded musicians to play with. I finally found some like counterparts, and
                            our punk/rock band "With The Punches" was formed in 2007. Since then, we released 3 albums and toured all over the United States, Canada,
                            Japan, and the United Kingdom. All the while, I would come home and work in the service industry. In 2013, With The Punches decided to call it quits.
                            We had a great run, but we had come to the point where we wanted to explore life outside of the band.

                        <p>
                            Since 2013, I have worked in many different restaurants in many positions. I have been a waiter, manager, kitchen staff, you name it. As these jobs
                            have helped me develop skills that are great to have in any workplace, I have not grown to be satisfied with this career path. Which brings me to today.
                            I am now enrolled in the UPenn Coding Bootcamp to dive headfirst into a new and interesting career. I am looking forward to becoming the best
                            web developer I can be, and to jumpstart this next chapter of my life.
